# DaveHub development roadmap

**Updated:** 21 October 2026. **Current stage:** DH-01A homepage first-look working prototype in review, without illustrated Dave. The primary domain is **davehub.co.uk** (purchased by owner), but hosting/DNS are unconfigured. No site has been deployed.

## Design baseline

- Three reference images are **locked**, with **Concept 1 as the owner's favourite and lead**.
- Concept 2 informs category portals; Concept 3 informs the observatory and interactive controls.
- The approved DaveHub logo is locked as an unchanged transparent PNG under `assets/branding/`; the exact-appearance SVG wrapper is approved. The distorted vector trace is discarded; no separate vector redraw is currently required.
- The text-free floating-islands homepage background is separately approved in `assets/homepage/` as PNG plus exact-appearance SVG wrapper; it is not genuine vector art.
- The main site is navigated through clickable destinations / scene transitions, **not** a walking avatar.
- A prominent **"I want to view this as a menu coz I'm boring"** link opens a deliberately basic **1990s-style HTML interface**.
- Both views share one approved project catalogue, stable routes and deep links.
- See [reference gallery](LOCKED_CONCEPTS.md), [visual direction](VISUAL_DIRECTION.md) and [retro menu brief](BORING_MENU.md).

## First-look review branch

- [DH-01A working homepage prototype](HOMEPAGE_FIRST_LOOK.md) has been built on `feature/dh-01a-homepage-first-look`, subject to design approval.
- Artwork is layered separately, with an empty `#dave-stage` placeholder for the future illustrated Dave.
- The first review focuses on the visual homepage and actual HTML buttons. The optional retro menu route is deferred from this increment; confirm its future place separately.

## Workflow

- Keep reference images unchanged and version any refinements separately; do not overwrite approved originals.
- Refine within the selected direction. New competing high-level visual concepts require explicit approval.
- Development should use small reviewable work packages, tests and preview links after an actual deployment.
- Update `PROJECT_STATE.json` and this roadmap at each completed work package.
- Publication of another project's source, asset or private content requires separate approval.
